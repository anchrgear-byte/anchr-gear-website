  <core_principles>
    1. **Raw Authenticity**: Unapologetic, bold, and direct. Reflects the "raw and hard" feedback the user requested.
    2. **High Contrast**: Stark differences between light and dark to emphasize the "transformation" aspect.
    3. **Industrial & Robust**: Reflects the durability of the gear and the strength of the user's journey.
    4. **Action-Oriented**: Focus on movement, sweat, and results.
  </core_principles>
  <color_philosophy>
    **Monochrome with Neon Accents**:
    - **Base**: Deep Charcoal (#1a1a1a) and Concrete Grey (#808080) to represent the "ANCHR" and stability.
    - **Accent**: Electric Pink (#ff00cc) and Cyan Blue (#00ccff) taken from the product colors (gloves/ropes) to cut through the darkness, symbolizing energy and vitality.
    - **Intent**: To show that fitness is a grind (dark/grey) but the results are vibrant (neon).
  </color_philosophy>
  <layout_paradigm>
    **Asymmetric Grid & Overlap**:
    - Breaking the grid to show movement.
    - Large, bold typography overlapping images.
    - "Split-screen" sections to contrast "before/after" or "rest/work".
  </layout_paradigm>
  <signature_elements>
    1. **Heavy Borders**: Thick, solid borders around buttons and image containers.
    2. **Stencil Typography**: Using stencil-like fonts for headings to evoke a military/industrial gym vibe.
    3. **Grainy Textures**: Subtle noise overlays on images to give a "raw" film look.
  </signature_elements>
  <interaction_philosophy>
    **Impactful & Direct**:
    - Hover effects that "snap" or "glitch" rather than fade.
    - Buttons that feel heavy and clickable.
    - Scroll-triggered reveals that are sudden and bold.
  </interaction_philosophy>
  <animation>
    **Hard Cuts & Slide-ins**:
    - Elements slide in quickly from the sides.
    - Text reveals are blocky (e.g., revealing line by line).
    - No soft fades; everything is deliberate.
  </animation>
  <typography_system>
    - **Headings**: 'Oswald' or 'Teko' (Condensed, Bold, Uppercase) - for maximum impact.
    - **Body**: 'Roboto Mono' or 'Space Mono' - for a technical, instructional feel.
