## THE PHILOSOPHY: NO GYM. NO EXCUSES.

You don't need a $100/month gym membership to change your life. You don't need a room full of chrome machines. You need gravity, intensity, and a plan.

This program is built for the "Grind." It's for the person who has 45 minutes before the kids wake up, or 45 minutes after a long shift. It's for the person who is rebuilding—whether that's from weight loss, injury, or just years of neglect.

We focus on **Progressive Overload**. This means doing more over time. More reps, more sets, less rest, or better form. We use minimal tools: Dumbbells, ANCHR Battle Ropes, and your own Bodyweight.

### EQUIPMENT NEEDED
1.  **Dumbbells:** A pair of adjustable dumbbells or a few fixed pairs (light, medium, heavy).
2.  **ANCHR Battle Ropes:** For conditioning, power, and core stability.
3.  **Bench or Sturdy Chair:** For support during presses and rows.
4.  **Yoga Mat:** For floor work.

## THE WARM-UP (DO THIS BEFORE EVERY SESSION)
