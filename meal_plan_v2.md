## THE PHILOSOPHY: FOOD IS FUEL

Most diets fail because they treat food as the enemy. They tell you to eat less, starve yourself, and be miserable. **That ends today.**

Your body is a machine. If you want it to perform—if you want to build muscle, burn fat, and crush your workouts—you need to fuel it.

**The ANCHR Rules of Nutrition:**
1.  **Protein is King:** It builds muscle and keeps you full. Every meal must have protein.
2.  **Real Food First:** If it comes in a box with a cartoon character on it, don't eat it.
3.  **Preparation is Key:** You will fail if you rely on willpower. You will succeed if you rely on preparation.

## PART 1: MACRO MASTERY

You don't need a degree in biochemistry. You just need to know your numbers.

### THE SIMPLE FORMULA
*   **Protein:** 1g per pound of goal body weight. (e.g., Goal is 150lbs = Eat 150g Protein)
*   **Fats:** 0.4g per pound of current body weight. (Essential for hormones)
*   **Carbs:** Fill the rest of your calories here. Eat them around your workouts.

### THE "HAND" METHOD (NO SCALES REQUIRED)
*   **Protein:** 1 Palm size portion (Chicken, Beef, Fish, Tofu)
*   **Carbs:** 1 Cupped Hand portion (Rice, Potatoes, Oats, Fruit)
*   **Fats:** 1 Thumb size portion (Oils, Nuts, Avocado)
*   **Veggies:** 1 Fist size portion (Broccoli, Spinach, Peppers) - *Eat as much as you want.*

## PART 8: THE ANCHR GROCERY STORE TOUR

Navigating the grocery store can be a trap. Here’s how to win.

**RULE #1: SHOP THE PERIMETER.** The outer ring of the store is where the real food lives: produce, meat, dairy. The inner aisles are a minefield of processed junk. Stick to the perimeter for 80% of your shopping.

**AISLE-BY-AISLE BATTLE PLAN:**

*   **PRODUCE:**
    *   **Win:** Load up on leafy greens (spinach, kale), cruciferous veggies (broccoli, cauliflower), and colorful peppers. Grab bananas for smoothies and berries for yogurt.
    *   **Lose:** Fruit juices (sugar bombs), pre-made fruit salads (often old and overpriced).

*   **MEAT & SEAFOOD:**
    *   **Win:** Boneless, skinless chicken breast, 93/7 or leaner ground turkey/beef, salmon, and shrimp. Look for sales and buy in bulk to freeze.
    *   **Lose:** Processed sausages, bacon, and mystery meat from the deli counter.

*   **DAIRY & EGGS:**
    *   **Win:** Plain non-fat Greek yogurt, cottage cheese, liquid egg whites, and whole eggs. These are protein powerhouses.
    *   **Lose:** Flavored yogurts (loaded with sugar), sugary coffee creamers, and full-fat cheese (use sparingly).

*   **THE INNER AISLES (DANGER ZONE):**
    *   **Carbs:** Rolled oats, brown/white rice, quinoa, and sweet potatoes are your allies. Whole wheat or chickpea pasta are also solid choices.
    *   **Canned Goods:** Canned tuna/salmon in water, black beans, and chickpeas are great to have on hand. Watch the sodium.
    *   **Fats:** Stick to olive oil, avocado oil, nuts, seeds, and natural peanut/almond butter (the kind you have to stir).
    *   **Frozen Foods:** Frozen veggies and fruits are just as nutritious as fresh and are often cheaper. Frozen shrimp and chicken breast are also great staples.

**RULE #2: READ THE LABEL.** Don't be fooled by flashy marketing. The only thing that matters is the **Nutrition Facts** panel and the **Ingredients List**. If the ingredient list is a paragraph long and full of words you can't pronounce, put it back.

## PART 9: EATING ON THE GO (NO EXCUSES)

Life happens. You can’t always meal prep. Here’s how to stay on track when you’re out.

**THE FAST FOOD SURVIVAL GUIDE:**

*   **Chipotle/Qdoba:** This is your #1 choice. Double protein (chicken or steak), fajita veggies, salsa, and lettuce. Skip the rice, cheese, and sour cream if you're cutting. Guac is a good fat source.
*   **Wendy's:** Grilled Chicken Sandwich (no mayo) or a Chili. Avoid the fries and Frosty.
*   **McDonald's:** Grilled chicken is gone, so this is a tough one. Your best bet is a McDouble (ask for no cheese, toss one bun) and a side salad. It's not great, but it's protein.
*   **Starbucks:** Egg white bites or a protein box. Avoid the Frappuccinos and pastries.

**THE GAS STATION GRAB:**

*   **Best Bets:** Beef jerky, protein bars (look for >15g protein, <10g sugar), nuts, hard-boiled eggs, or a pre-made protein shake (like Muscle Milk or Fairlife).
*   **Avoid:** Chips, candy, and sugary drinks.

**THE RESTAURANT RULE:**

When you eat at a sit-down restaurant, follow this simple rule: **Double Protein, Double Veggies, Half Carbs.**

*   **Example:** If you order a steak dinner, ask for a double portion of steak, double broccoli, and half the mashed potatoes.
*   **Pro Tip:** Ask for sauces and dressings on the side so you can control how much you use.

Staying on track is about making the **best available choice**, not the perfect choice. Don't let one unplanned meal derail your entire week.
