## THE PHILOSOPHY: UNLEASH THE ROPES

Most people think battle ropes are just a "finisher" to burn a few extra calories at the end of a workout. **They are wrong.**

With **ANCHR Wireless Battle Ropes**, you aren't tethered to a wall. You have total freedom of movement. This program uses that freedom to turn the ropes into your primary tool for building explosive power, core stability, and functional strength.

We use **Contrast Training**: Pairing a heavy strength movement (using dumbbells or bodyweight) immediately with an explosive rope movement. This forces your muscles to fire at maximum capacity even when fatigued.

### EQUIPMENT NEEDED
1.  **ANCHR Wireless Battle Ropes:** The centerpiece of this program.
2.  **Dumbbells:** A pair of adjustable dumbbells or a few fixed pairs.
3.  **Yoga Mat:** For floor work.
