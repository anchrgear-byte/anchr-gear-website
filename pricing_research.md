### Price Point Analysis for ANCHR Gear ($34.99)
*   **Comparison:**
    *   Significantly higher than generic Amazon/Walmart options ($12-15).
    *   Higher than standard Nike/Gymshark entry-level ($20-26).
    *   **Comparable to:** Lululemon's entry-level ($38) and Gymshark's "Legacy" line ($44).
    *   **Lower than:** Specialized boutique brands like G-Loves ($60).

### Initial Thoughts
*   $34.99 places ANCHR Gear in the **"Premium Essential"** category.
*   To justify this price, the gloves cannot look generic. They must compete with Lululemon's aesthetic and Gymshark's higher-tier "Legacy" line.
*   The "Bundle" strategy is crucial here—bundling lowers the perceived cost of the gloves when bought with ropes.

### Next Steps
*   Deep dive into *features* of the $35+ gloves. What materials are they using? (Leather vs. Synthetic, Wrist wrap support, etc.)
*   Analyze customer reviews for the $35+ bracket to see what justifies the price for buyers (e.g., "doesn't rip," "cute design," "wrist support").
