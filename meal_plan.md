## THE PHILOSOPHY: FOOD IS FUEL

Most diets fail because they treat food as the enemy. They tell you to eat less, starve yourself, and be miserable. **That ends today.**

Your body is a machine. If you want it to perform—if you want to build muscle, burn fat, and crush your workouts—you need to fuel it.

**The ANCHR Rules of Nutrition:**
1.  **Protein is King:** It builds muscle and keeps you full. Every meal must have protein.
2.  **Real Food First:** If it comes in a box with a cartoon character on it, don't eat it.
3.  **Preparation is Key:** You will fail if you rely on willpower. You will succeed if you rely on preparation.

## PART 1: MACRO MASTERY

You don't need a degree in biochemistry. You just need to know your numbers.

### THE SIMPLE FORMULA
*   **Protein:** 1g per pound of goal body weight. (e.g., Goal is 150lbs = Eat 150g Protein)
*   **Fats:** 0.4g per pound of current body weight. (Essential for hormones)
*   **Carbs:** Fill the rest of your calories here. Eat them around your workouts.

### THE "HAND" METHOD (NO SCALES REQUIRED)
*   **Protein:** 1 Palm size portion (Chicken, Beef, Fish, Tofu)
*   **Carbs:** 1 Cupped Hand portion (Rice, Potatoes, Oats, Fruit)
*   **Fats:** 1 Thumb size portion (Oils, Nuts, Avocado)
*   **Veggies:** 1 Fist size portion (Broccoli, Spinach, Peppers) - *Eat as much as you want.*
